# MNIST Dataset Classification with PCA

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of working with the MNIST dataset and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the accuracy of handwritten digit classification. The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset for practicing image classification tasks, while PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance.

## Dataset Description

The MNIST dataset comprises a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. It serves as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly in computer vision.

### Dataset Source

The MNIST dataset can be directly accessed from various sources, including Kaggle's built-in datasets or the official MNIST database.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebook included in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
